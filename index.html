                            <p>Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of intelligent effort. This is what we strive to realize through C.F. Andrews International School. We believe that, like everything else, education needs to be in a ‘progressive
                                mode’, especially in this fast-changing world. As we see, the number of schools is rapidly on the rise with fast expansion of education. However, the question is: are all these schools worldwide and especially in India,
                                ready to embrace the change which has become inevitable in today’s progressive, global society? What elements are needed to be imbibed in delivery of education so that it meets the needs of time, is compatible with international
                                standards and is able to review and evaluate its outcome in order to improve? In other words, how many of them are truly ‘Leaders’ in the arena of children education?</p>
                            <p>C.F. Andrews International School is the Indian offshoot of this global organization.</p>
                            <p>We are an elite organization striving to add a new dimension to schools worldwide by creating a unique progressive environment for the new age global kids. As we all are aware, we live in a rapidly changing time where only
                                a progressive outlook can ensure our survival and growth. This calls for changing the mind sets of our school leaders and bind them in a common vision as well as unity of purpose so that a fostering environment is created
                                for optimizing the inherent potential, aptitude and creative instinct of every child.
                            </p>
                            <p>At ‘C.F. Andrews International School, we are dedicated to help the member schools to excel and create new benchmarks in the field of children’s education by continuously raising their own standards. We believe that in this
                                age of rat-race, quality schools have to make a niche for themselves by adopting best practices, best technology, inclusiveness, care for environment, contribution to the human society and smart pedagogy to cater to the
                                developmental needs of every child.
                            </p>
                            <p>With such a holistic mission and far-sighted strategies, we continue to increase our membership in India and are eager to collaborate with them. We believe that the member schools will learn from the experiences of one another
                                and ‘grow together’ leveraging from this rich milieu of insights gained from schools creating a benchmark in different settings and nurturing children from varied backgrouds.
                            </p>
                            <p>To reiterate, the ‘C.F. Andrews International School intends to help its member schools excel and create new benchmarks in the field of education by continuously raising their own standards.</p>
                            <p>Undoubtedly, this goal is very ‘intangible’ and cannot be immediately measured in terms of ‘material deliverables’. However, in course of time its visible results will manifest themselves in many countable terms. Moreover,
                                every organization keeps evolving along its experience with increasing participation of its members and continuous consultation with them. As such, the purpose of and the services rendered by CFAIS will keep crystallizing
                                with the passage of time. At this juncture, we do not intend to involve into tall talks.
                            </p>
                            <p>Moreover, CFAIS gives the quality schools of India a common, globally-connected platform for learning and sharing as well as for bringing their noble efforts into limelight, because if the world does not know you as a ‘Quality’
                                school, all your efforts will be like winking in the dark.</p>
                            <p>‘C.F. Andrews International School is an accrediting body but it is far different from other accrediting agencies which often give out a ranking based on material gains. Accordingly, their so-called ‘Ranking’ keeps changing
                                year by year.</p>
                            <p>
                                We want to bring transparency, sense of justice and an approach of genuine appreciation in this field.</p><br>

                                    conviction that in a world which is changing every millisecond, education needs to evolve too at a similar pace.“CAPTAIN BRAJRAJ SINGH WELFARE SOCIETY” has accepted this challenge to establish a chain of other schools

                                    team of dedicated staff makes up for the ideal education ambience at C. F. Andrews International School,Sankra Aligarh. I firmly believe that every child is capable of his/her full development. As the saying goes,”
                                    a child's mind is like a dry sponge, ready to soak, all you need to do is to take it to the water". It only needs the right environment in the school and at home. I invite you to visit our school feel the vibrations

                                <p>I still remember a time when the world didn’t fit in the palm of my hand. An entire generation today has no recollection of that. The world is suddenly very small, and yet the possibilities are limitless. Technology has
                                    allowed learning to be truly boundless. Nothing is out of reach anymore. Information, knowledge, instruction – every aspect of learning is now just a click or a tap away. And it is an extremely liberating experience.</p>
                                <p>What I am trying to assert is that today technology is poised to ensure that India truly embraces its status as the world’s largest democracy. Because technology powers knowledge, and empowered by knowledge every individual
                                    is equal.</p>
                                <p>So, as an alumnus I am proud to see my alma mater embrace the digital age. As the country gains a firm foothold in the technology landscape, I am sure that “C. F. Andrews International School” will endow the new generation
                                    of students with every skill they need to fully embrace the possibilities that the future presents.</p>

                                <p>I believe my role as an educator is to guide and nurture the next generation to establish skills to achieve health, respect, prosperity and fulfillment.</p>
                                <p>I am passionate about students being empowered to succeed. As Principal, I use all tools available to inspire staff, students and community to work together to promote student achievement and well-being. </p>
                                <p>I am an avid supporter of effective and innovative professional development that encourages teachers to be reflective and to continuously examine our practice to provide quality teaching and learning for each student. My
                                    role as Principal is to keep up with latest trends and research and be an active partner in the school's professional development.</p>
                                <p>The ability to be innovative and creative is important to me. I enjoy being challenged and inspired by the people around me. I aim to enthuse and challenge staff and students to also be inventive and imaginative in their
                                    learning and day to day tasks.</p>
                                <p>I believe that having quality, inspirational and passionate teachers is essential to a school's success. To borrow John Hattie's words; "teachers should build classroom climates where errors are welcome, student engagement
                                    is the norm, questioning is high and students gain reputations as effective learners." I enjoy celebrating successes and acknowledge hard work of staff, students and community and believe this is one of the contributors
                                    fundamental to a happy school environment. All staff, students and community should feel valued and appreciated at school.
                                </p>
                                <p>Community engagement and involvement in the school is important to me as Principal. I regularly consult with my community as part of school self review and encourage community engagement in the curriculum and learning programmers.</p>
